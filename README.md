# Programming Foundations with Python (PY110)

Advanced Python course covering data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets), comprehensions, nested collections, sorting algorithms, iterable unpacking, PEDAC problem-solving methodology, and debugging with pdb.

## Core Concepts Mastered

### Data Structures & Collections
- **Python Collections**: Deep dive into strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, ranges
- **Nested Data Structures**: Working with multi-dimensional collections and complex hierarchies
- **Iterable Unpacking**: Advanced unpacking techniques for sequences and mappings
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Custom sort keys, multi-level sorting, stability

### Iteration & Comprehensions
- **List Comprehensions**: Efficient collection transformation and filtering
- **Dictionary & Set Comprehensions**: Creating mappings and unique collections
- **Iterator Patterns**: for loops, while loops, and generator expressions

### Problem Solving
- **PEDAC Process**: Systematic problem-solving framework (Problem, Examples, Data structure, Algorithm, Code)
- **Selection & Transformation**: Functional patterns for data manipulation
- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable components

### Debugging
- **pdb**: Python debugger for breakpoints, step-through execution, and variable inspection
- **Systematic Debugging**: Identifying root causes and isolating issues

## Projects

### [Tic Tac Toe](./lesson_3/tictactoe.py)
Classic game implementation with AI opponent. Demonstrates game state management, win condition evaluation, and user interaction patterns.

**Key concepts:** Nested lists for board state, minimax-style AI logic, input validation, game loop architecture

### [Twenty-One (Blackjack)](./lesson_3/twenty_one.py)
Card game implementation with dealer logic and game rules. Demonstrates OOP principles, randomization, and complex rule evaluation.

**Key concepts:** Deck/card modeling, hand evaluation algorithms, dealer AI, game flow control
